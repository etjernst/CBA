# Getting started with your project

1.  Have an initial meeting to exchange contact information and to appoint a client liaison. This person will be the primary point of contact with the client. You will want to discuss team roles and how you want to coordinate your efforts. Some division of labor is likely efficient, but you remember that should all plan to be full participants in both the analysis and the writing.
2.  Get started on background research. [This](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/06/synthesizing-different-bodies-of-work-in-your-literature-review-the-conceptual-synthesis-excel-dump-technique/) is an excellent resource how to conduct a literature review and how to synthesize different bodies of work via an "Excel dump."
  - As you prepare your initial literature review, I recommend having everyone on the team begin an _independent_ research effort to find relevant materials. You can then meet to discuss what each person has found. You will all learn more this way, and you will likely find a greater variety of materials.
  - Consider creating a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/) to manage your references and bibliography. If you have never used Zotero or a similar bibliography management program, this is a great time to start! It will save you time and sanity - especially on group projects.  
   - You may want to organize your project on dropbox, Box, or google drive. [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) are both great collaboration tools for writing.
3.  Contact your client and begin the project! I do recommend reading up on the topic of your project before you have your first call with them.

The project reports are designed to build up to the final report. Your CBA report grade will be based on the team's _final product_. I provide rubrics for the project reports to help you pay attention to the right things -- not to grade you.<br>

#### Project report 1
Describe the issue you are tackling in your CBA, and lay out a plan for completion. Please prepare a 4-6 page double-spaced report that describes the issue being addressed in the project and sketches a plan for completion. Think of this as a first draft of your introduction, plus a plan outline.

| **Criteria**|**Excellent**| **Good**| **Fair**|**Poor**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Organization*| Report is clear and logical. Reader can easily follow line of reasoning.| Report is generally clear. A few minor points may be confusing.| Reader can follow with effort. Organization is not well thought out.| Report is very confusing and unclear. Hard to follow.
|*Presentation & style* | Style is appropriate for a formal brief. Not too casual. Language does not hinder reader's ability to follow. No typos.| Style is generally appropriate. May contain some issues. Minor grammatical or typographical errors.| Report is too informal or unprepared. Difficult to understand. Much of the information lacks focus and clarity. Multiple typos or poor overall editing. | Report is consistently at an inappropriate level. Information is poorly synthesized. Difficult for reader to understand the point. Last-minute, not proof-read. |
| *Content: accuracy*| Information given is accurate and backed up by facts. Sources are appropriately cited (no webpage URLs please!).| Information contains no significant errors but some sources are unclear or poorly cited.| Some components lack sources or are incorrect. Enough errors to distract the reader, but some information is accurate.| Information is so inaccurate or poorly cited that reader cannot depend on the reported results and work.|
| *Content: depth*|Sources cited and information used comes from a variety of sources and is clearly synthesized and presented. The problem statement is well-justified by the sources.| Sources cited and information used are generally described in a clear manner. Reasonable connection between information and problem statement.|Some components missing or minimally developed. Little discussion of problem statement in a broader context.| Connection between project statement and the relevant information is very difficult to follow. Sources cited are few and/or irrelevant.|



#### Project report 2
Prepare a complete report on the data that you have from your client, as well as other data sources. Show clearly that you have begun working with and understand the data.

I encourage you to present summary statistics and basic figures describing your data. Describe how you plan to use the data to compute costs and benefits and note any data sources that you are still missing or assembling.
