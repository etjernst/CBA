# Brief project descriptions

## 1. Payments for Eco-system Services in Burkina Faso

Conserving and restoring degraded tropical forest landscapes is a potentially cost-effective way to achieve climate mitigation. Trees could contribute to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions! But of course trees don't grow on trees! How and where the conservation takes place will affect the overall benefits to society. This project will evaluate an afforestation campaign by the government of Burkina Faso. Remote sensing estimates of tree cover in key degraded forests revealed tree cover as low as 40%.  The project involved rolling out a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) program that aimed to align individualsâ€™ private incentives with the public environmental benefits of increased forest cover. You will evaluate the costs and benefits of this program. This will likely include calculating the project's net greenhouse gas mitigation, placing a monetary value on the project's impacts on participants' food security, and weighing these benefits against program costs.<br>
