## Sensitivity analysis



















## What is different about developing countries?

### This class: Agricultural households
* Household uses many of its own inputs
* Household consumes part or often all of its output

---
### Ag household model
We look at them as consumers first

1. consumers like stuff
2. they like both food and other things and most likely they would like to consume as much as possible
3. Between (3,3) and (4,4) it is obvious which we would like, right?
4. But what about (5,3)? Or (3.5,5)?<br>
--> if indifferent between these then that maps out the **indifference curve**
5. Higher indifference curve == better
6. BUT of course we can't consumer as much as we want of everything; deciding under constraints<br>
--> constraint is the budget

### What was special about point A again?
It was where marginal rate of substitution = ratio of prices
* Find this by finding the tangency point of the indifference curve and the budget line
* If we have a very steep indifference curve, then it will not be tangent to the budget line at A
* At each point, the indifference curve is steeper than the budget line
* So the consumer is willing to give up more y for a unit of x than the market requires
> i.e. wants a bundle with more x and less y

* Where the I curve intersects the budget line, they would like to trade more y for some more x, but they can't because this is all they have!
* The price of other stuff is relatively too high, so we only consume food
* If price of other stuff is lower, i.e. budget line steeper, then we could move towards an **interior solution**
---
### Increase price of food

* **B** Consume less food and less other stuff
* **C** If we could stay on same indifference curve --> substitution effect; substitute away from food

### Are we done?
No! Budget line includes profits from food production
* Producer theory
* What is on our axes when we draw firm behavior?

### Which of these budget lines are we looking at?

---
### So are farm hh better or worse off when prices of food increase?
**It depends!!**
  * Household gains as a producer but loses as a consumer
  * Big surplus-producing hhs gain most!
  * Net buyers will lose!

---
### Big implications for ag and food policy!
* If government wants to increase food supply for urban consumers, a policy that raises food price may not result in a big supply increase!
* In fact, **if profit response is large enough it could backfire!**
* Could lead to urban consumers paying more, with little increase in supply!
  > Second one is bad news!

---
### Net benefit ratio
> MS = 0 means you consume your whole production<br>
> MS = 250 - 50 = 200<br>
> E = 500<br>
> 200/500 = 0.4<br>
> **INTERPRETATION?** 1% INCREASE IN PRICE -> 0.4% INCREASE IN WELFARE<BR>

* How would you interpret a negative NBR?
   * Loss in welfare
   * Who is this true for? (non-ag households)

---
### Derivation of NBR:

* Let's write a stylized representation of the household's income as $Y = E+\mu + \pi(p;A)$
  * $E$ represent labor earnings
  * $\mu$ stands for other income
  * $\pi$ stands for the profits that the household makes depending on the prevailing prices and production assets $A$ (here, think of them as land for example)
  * let the profit function be the simple $\pi(p;A) = p*q - \text{costs}$
> We want to know what happens to the household's income when the price changes a tiny bit. Call the change $dp$.
---

  * the NBR expresses the marginal effect of a price change as a fraction of income
  * $NBR > 0$ for individuals who are net producers of commodity $i$
  * $NBR < 0$ for individuals who are net producers of commodity $i$

---
### The supply response depends on price elasticity of supply!
* Land is fixed
* Poor soil quality
* Low access to technology and/or information
* No insurance to protect against crop failure
* Liquidity constraints
* Labor constraints
   * Some people want to respond but cannot

### Lots of people don't participate in the market at all!
* How do we model people who don't participate in markets?

---
### Why do we care so much about market participation?
* What would you do if all markets disappeared tomorrow?
* You are your own market: whatever you can produce, you consume
* Note that without markets, there are no prices left in the world
* But no prices doesn't mean that you don't value things!
  * think for a second about your most valued possession, let's say that it's your phone
  * now that markets are gone, I come by your house and say "Hey nice phone"

* I suspect that your shadow value of food may have gone up without markets!
  * shadow price definition  

> Formally, a shadow price for those who have taken some optimization is **the value of the Lagrange multiplier at the optimal solution**, i.e. the infinitesimal change in the objective function arising from an infinitesimal change in the constraint

---
### Market participation: informal trade
* Even a village market would make you better off
  * maybe one of you has a hidden talent for making candles
  * Kaylah can offer her cow-naming services for piano entertainment (Will has piano talents)
  * instead of each and every one of us having to produce everything we need, we can start to specialize
  * my tomato garden is super productive, but there are only so many tomatoes I can eat!
    * without markets I have little incentive to produce very much at all, just enough to feed myself


---
### With and without markets
* Markets are critical to economic welfare because they bring together sellers and buyers
* They integrate information as if by magic (information = people's valuations for stuff -> prices for stuff)
> Flip side: missing markets produce inefficiencies<br>
> When markets don't work, prices can vary from one place to another:
> * in my village we have a lot of workers so wages are low, but we don't have any wood to make fires with
> * you have a forest but no workers to cut down the trees
> * varying prices over space and time suggests imperfectly integrated markets

**Non-tradable** good is a good for which an economy doesn't have a market
* So let's look at how to model what happens when we introduce markets more formally

---
### Modeling this stuff
* Back to the PPF framework
* Remember, the PPF us the various combinations of two goods produced<br> if we allocate **all** inputs (labor/ land/etc.) to production
> Where will this household produce?

* Produce where MRT = MRS (marginal rate of transformation = marginal rate of substitution)

<br>

> What are the prices of things here?
**NO PRICES**<br>
> Only shadow prices!

---
### Introduce markets
* Now what if the household can trade tomatoes and fish at the prevailing market prices?
* The market trade-off between rice and fish is the ratio of these two prices
 > Now we have decoupled production from demand!!

### Agricultural productivity in SSA is low
* Should we invest in boosting the productivity in ag sector?
  * a large literature thinks about whether agricultural growth is a pre-requisite for growth in other sectors
  * how important is agriculture as a development strategy, relative to other sectors?
>  * both of these are more controversial & harder to answer than you might think
---
### Stylized facts about agriculture in SSA
* Agriculture is the biggest sector in most sub-Saharan economies in terms of employment (60% on average)
  * most are not employed as wage workers, but operate their own farms
* Most farmers farm really tiny plots
  > * note that this does **not** tell us anything about why ag productivity in SSA is low!
  > * tiny plots don't have to be unproductive---but they are _correlated_ in SSA
  * also, rural households tend to be worse off
* Generally, rural households are poorer than urban
---
### How do we interpret these facts?

* Many possible interpretations!
1. Important to raise ag productivity since it will **benefit many people**
2. Many of the people who would benefit are poor so would lift  many out of poverty
3. Food security
4. Some argue that ag growth has been a precursor to economics growth everywhere
> Of course most of these estimates are not causal!

**So partly the answer is: it depends on your goals**

---
### What about the costs?
* (Most likely) we have discussed the benefits of investing in ag
* But if so many people are employed in the ag sector and it produces very little...
> Opportunity costs!<br>
> What else could people be doing with their time and skills?
---
### Value added per worker
1. What is another way to measure productivity?
2. Think back to our Solow model, what is our metric of welfare?
> Output per capita!

![](assets/Lecture_10_notes-953d4268.png)

* Define: agricultural value added

---
### What about opportunity costs?
* Agricultural productivity gap: the ratio of value added per worker in non-ag over the value added per worker in ag

---
### If we wanted to change, how would we do it?
* Magruder evaluates the experimental work on this topic
1. Credit
2. Insurance
3. Information

* Why would information matter so much?
  * poor info about prices
  * poor info about returns to fertilizer
  * low education and/or trust
  * info may be biased or not fit you very well
